# [🦝 MiguelPimentel.do](https://miguelpimentel.do/)

Personal website and blog. Contains a short list of my projects, blog posts, and tutorials. Built using [Astro Micro](https://github.com/trevortylerlee/astro-micro).

A few adjustments were made to the original theme. Here's a short list:

- Used "Email" instead of the actual email address under the "Let's Connect" section.
- Created new "About" page.
- Created new "Uses" page.
- Created new "Tutorials" section.
- Created new `LetsConnect.astro` component using the "Let's Connect".
