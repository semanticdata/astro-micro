                Hello, my name is Miguel Pimentel. I am an engineering project
                manager and self-taught hobby developer with too many ideas and
                not enough time. I was born in the Dominican Republic, and
                currently live in Minnesota, US.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think a lot, work a lot, have existential crises, and know
                just enough about making websites to make me dangerous. I enjoy
                writing, reading, coding, listening to music, and love having a
                problem to solve.

                A chronic case of curiosity leads me to learn and do many
                interesting things.
                <br />
                For example:

                  … designing bike trails and residential roads in AutoCAD Civil
                  3D.

                <li>

                <li>… learning web development and computer programming.</li>
                <li>… getting licensed as a Firefighter.</li>
                <li>… getting certified as Emergency Medical Technician.</li>
                <li>… inspecting public road construction projects.</li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                In my spare time, I'm drawn to a diverse range of interests,
                including web development, public infrastructure, fire science,
                digital gardening, materials science, game development, and
                personal knowledge management.

              <p>
                Professionally, I work as an <b>
                  Engineering Project Manager
                </b>
                for the <Link href="https://www.crystalmn.gov/"
                  >City of Crystal, MN
                </Link>. Some of my duties include preparing detailed plans,
                specifications, solicitations, proposals for bids, and cost
                estimates; managing contracts from bid solicitation through
                project completion; and inspecting ongoing and completed
                construction for compliance with those specifications. I also
                help maintain accurate project records, review as-built plans,
                and oversee right-of-way management and permitting. My role
                involves working closely with various private and public
                agencies, utilizing GIS and CAD systems, and assisting with <Link
                  href="https://www.jwcontap.org/">Joint Water Commission</Link
                > and <Link href="https://bwsr.state.mn.us/watershed-districts"
                  >Watershed District</Link
                > functions.
              </p>
              <p>
                With over 10 years of experience in public construction, I have
                amassed a number of unique projects and experiences that cover
                many different fields. It all started when I got my first job as
                a Civil Engineering Technician for a contracting company near my
                university. I was at the time attending
                <Link href="https://www.intec.edu.do/">INTEC</Link> while pursuing
                a Bachelor's in Civil Engineering. Unfortunately, I was unable to
                finish my college education due to personal reasons.
              </p>

              <p>
                Nevertheless, today I thrive having experience in not only
                public infrastructure, but technology, electrical, rail, and bus
                related projects as well. In the past, you could also find me
                working as a volunteer/on-call <b>Firefighter</b> for the City of
                Bloomington. If interested, take a look at my
