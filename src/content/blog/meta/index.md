This website is powered by [Astro Micro](https://github.com/trevortylerlee/astro-micro), a blog theme for [Astro](https://astro.build) that comes with search and comments.

That said, a few changes have been made to the original theme. Here's a small list:

- Created new [About](/about) page.
- Created new [Uses](/uses) page.
- Created new [Tutorials](/tutorials) section.

The source code for this website is available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/semanticdata/personal-website).
