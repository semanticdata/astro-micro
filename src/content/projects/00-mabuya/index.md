## ‚ìò Background

While searching for themes, I came across [Zola Tale](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola). Sadly, the project's last update was on Dec, 2021. Shortly after, I decided to fork the project and add my own touches to it.

The name **Mabuya** comes from the [Mabuya hispaniolae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabuya_hispaniolae?useskin=vector), a possibly extinct[^1] species of skink endemic to the Dominican Republic, my home country.

## ‚ú® Features and Improvements

While working on the theme, I have added new functionality and made many quality of life improvements. Here's a short list:

- Refactored stylesheets.
- Added Dark theme and color theme toggle.
- Added new footer navigation.
- Created a custom GitHub Action to deploy Zola sites faster than any other GitHub Actions using Docker.
- Refined page transitions from desktop to mobile and viceversa.
- Centralized custom variables‚Äìmade it easier to customize the site's colors.
- Addressed PR [#7](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/pull/7) fixing the pagination problem present in the original Zola theme.
- Addressed Issue [#4](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/4) fixing custom text not being used correctly.
- Addressed (temporarily) Issue [#1](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/1) by removing the erroneous pinned marker.
- Optimized for speed and accessibility. Subtle color changes to make the text more readable, etc.
- Many other small improvements...

## üöÄ Quick Start

Before using the theme, you need to install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ‚â• v0.18.0.

### 1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:semanticdata/mabuya.git
```

### 2. Change directory into clone

```sh
cd mabuya
```

### 3. Serve the site locally

```sh
zola serve
```

For more detailed instructions, visit the [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) page about installing and using themes.

## üé® Customization

You can change the configuration, templates and content yourself. Refer to the [config.toml](config.toml), and [templates](templates) for ideas. In most cases you only need to modify the contents of [config.toml](config.toml) to customize the appearance of your blog. Make sure to visit the Zola [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

Adding custom CSS is as easy as adding your styles to [sass/_custom.scss](sass/_custom.scss). This is made possible because SCSS files are backwards compatible with CSS. This means you can type normal CSS code into a SCSS file and it will be valid.
